AI Supervisor is an open source project from Open Gradient. It is an ML augmentation tool and was originally designed for conduct risk/surveillance staff within financial services. 

There are multiple machine learning models at work here. The core task of classification is performed using a fine tuned Distil Bert Model.  I bolted on some additional features to this APP versus the core app. Those additional features include text summarization and named entity recognition models(NER). Out of curiosity I used two older models for NER and Summarization to see how they would compare with the newer and much larger transformer models. They take longer but I like the output from the transformer models.   

Any questions please rach out on client.services@opengradient.com
